# RuKira's Gunsmith Tweaks

## Overview

I personally hate how Mechanic wants you to build a gun, but makes you go buy them or find them. It's not lore accurate in my opinion.
So now Mechanic gives you the weapon he wants you to build, but only the base. You still have to mod it. Mechanic finally did something and found the weapons himself.

Does not change:
- Gunsmith Part 2: Gun already supplied
- Gunsmith Part 25: The challenge is getting the gun itself

## Config

Added: 

Enabled -

This will disable or enable the mod itself, this exist for people that want to quickly disable the mod without having to uninstall it... for some reason?

Planned:

Parts / LoreAccurate (What ever I decide to call it) -

The plan around this config, when I do add it is Mechanic needs you to build a gun, sometimes he has the parts, sometimes he doesn't.

Not all parts should be found/bought he should have some parts on him and just wants you to build it. That's where this setting comes in.

I have hand selected parts for each gunsmith to give the player to build that I feel is LoreAccruate to Mechanic.

This feature mainly exist for my friends and I, so there's a config to straight up disable this feature. 

If "Enabled" is disabled this is also disabled.

## Planned Features

Parts / LoreAccurate

Prapor's Quest? Maybe...

Mod Overhaul, Mod.ts getting kinda big - Will implement later.

This mod may branch out into something bigger, we see.
