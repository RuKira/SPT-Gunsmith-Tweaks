I need an upgraded Simonov carbine, with a silencer and optic scope. 20-round or larger mag, ergonomics over 35, recoil sum no more than 350."

All that because TerraGroup allegedly uses \"Ebambium\" ISP to further destabilize the situation in the city and wreak havoc. Sounds like some gibberish about the Ragnarok coming, don't you think? By the way about gibberish and weapons — some weirdo with a lightning symbol tattooed on his face asked for a Remington 870 shotgun. Equipped with a tactical device, Magpul MOE handguard, and a tactical foregrip. Ergonomics above 60 and recoil sum less than 500."

I've been thinking about this all the time after that guy with the lightning tattoo. Although I decided for myself that even if it’s someone's invisible hand, our society has deserved it. We have, by our actions, by buying sneakers or even beet salad, supported those who build laboratories and manufacturers, and then use them to plunge us into the abyss. Okay, I’m rambling again, back to business. Get me an AKM with a Fortis Shift grip, silencer, and 30-round Magpul mag. Ergonomics over 40, recoil sum less than 400, sighting range of 800 meters or more."

People, their values, their thoughts, and their goals. They don't know anymore why they should take joy, work, have children. Everyone is tired from the illusion of choice they were offered all this time, from having to work and buy either blue or red cigarettes. It’s happening everywhere, in every corner of the world. But here in Tarkov, we are honest with ourselves. We see it all in an already exaggerated way, without false values, when you don't just decide what laundry detergent is better at removing stains, but how to keep warm at night and where to find ammo to deal with the next lowlife who wants to kill you. Only in such an honest society, people show their true selves. What do you think? Okay, thanks for hearing me out. Some folks requested a fully packed M4. They need a silencer, 60-round extended mag, ergonomics above 47, and recoil sum less than 300. And mind the weight, no more than 3.8 kg, with a sighting range of 800 or beyond."

Ergonomics should be over 65, recoil sum less than 275, and the gun should be taking up no more than 10 slots. And most importantly, with an B-30 handguard with B-31S upper handguard rail, RK-0 tactical foregrip, AK-12 magazine, Klesch-2IKS, and DTK-1, Zenit all around.

However, I trained it with movies and phrases from them. Apparently, such a reaction is presented to us in the movies as the most appropriate, but not for me. I'll have to think about what stimuli are the best to mimic real people, rather than society and its stereotypes. But I digress, assemble an AK-105 now, with a silencer and 60-round mag.

What do you think, will this time come someday? I think it will, very soon. We already don't know what processes occur inside neural networks, there is only an entry signal and the result of its actions, and how it has learned with its own internal rules, wiring up its own neural links inside itself. How is it different from us? Would you love living in a world where your actions get limited only by your mind and imagination? The truth is, I think, living in such a world would be no better than in our own if there is no goal. And where can a goal come from if you're immortal and omnipotent... This time we need an AS VAL.

        "description": "What do you think, how much does human life cost? Not much, I guess. But what’s even more surprising for me, it’s the contemporary art market. The value of art pieces by renowned artists grows every year. They are definitely talented, but the more you look at it, the more it seems that anything can be art. It can be a Rothko painting, a displaced urinal, or a bunch of garbage. However, in my opinion, the most amazing pieces of art are weapons, starting from the melee - which is already universally recognized as such and can be found in many museums - to an old AK or M4, which are beautiful as they are. But a weapon only transcends to true art when it becomes unique, one-of-a-kind, in the hands of someone who knows how to use it, who modifies it for his own needs, creating a masterpiece worthy of being displayed in the best of museums. Bring me one such masterpiece, an M4A1 with a KAC QDSS NT-4 (FDE) silencer, Alexander Arms MK10 rifle-length handguard, REAP-IR thermal scope, and a 60-round magazine. Ergonomics should be not less than 40, the recoil sum less than 270, and the weight of 5 kg or less."
